#+title: Tracking Packages With Org-Mode
#+date: 2022-12-06
#+draft: false
#+tags[]: emacs

December is the season to mail and receive packages. To keep track of them, I create a
~TODO~ item for each package in an Emacs' org file. I make note of the mailing date, the
content of the package, and the tracking number. The advantage of using Emacs is that a
few line of code can make the tracking numbers clickable.

(defun org-link-track-ups (path arg)
  "Track a ups package where PATH is the tracking number."
  (browse-url
   (url-encode-url
    (concat "https://www.ups.com/track?loc=en_US&tracknum=" path))
   arg))

(defun org-link-track-usps (path arg)
  "Track a usps package where PATH is the tracking number."
  (browse-url
   (url-encode-url
    (concat "https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction.action?tLabels="
            path))
   arg))

(defun org-link-track-fedex (path arg)
  "Track a fedex package where PATH is the tracking number."
  (browse-url
   (url-encode-url
    (concat "https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?trknbr=" path))
   arg))

(org-link-set-parameters "ups"
                         :follow 'org-link-track-ups
                         :face '(:foreground "green" :underline t))
(org-link-set-parameters "usps"
                         :follow 'org-link-track-usps
                         :face '(:foreground "green" :underline t))
(org-link-set-parameters "fedex"
                         :follow 'org-link-track-fedex
                         :face '(:foreground "green" :underline t))
#+end_src

Then, I can just type ~[[ups:<tracking number]]~ in an org file and ~open-at-point~
lets me know where is my package.
